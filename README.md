Experimental three.js website.  
This is going to be bloated and messy because I have no clue what I'm doing.  
I'm not using `svelthree` because I have no clue how three works, and there's basically no docs for svelthree.

I'm not going to include the 3d models in the repo, so this won't work for you.
